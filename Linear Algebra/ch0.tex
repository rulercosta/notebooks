\section*{Motivation to learn Linear Algebra}

\para

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that is widely used throughout science and engineering. Linear algebra is a form of continuous mathematics. 

\para

Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations, linear maps, and their representations in vector spaces and through matrices. Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics.

\para

There are several prerequisites for a better understanding of Machine Learning and (especially) Deep Learning algorithms. In order to grasp the nitty-gritties of higher ML concepts, one needs to have a strong base in higher mathematics.

\para

Linear Algebra is the mathematical foundation that solves the problem of representing data as well as computations in machine learning models.

\para

Hence, the concepts of linear algebra are crucial for understanding the theory behind machine learning, especially for deep learning.
