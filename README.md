# My Python and Data Science Journey

This repository documents my ongoing journey in learning Python, data science, and related fields. Through these notebooks and materials, I track my progress, experiments, and knowledge acquisition in various technical domains.

## Repository Structure

### Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Numpy**: Notebooks demonstrating NumPy operations, linear algebra, and numerical methods
  - `Numpy.ipynb`: Core NumPy functionality, array operations, and mathematical applications
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization examples and techniques
  - `Matplotlib.ipynb`: Basic to advanced plotting, customization, and specialized charts
- **Math**: Mathematics concepts and applications
  - `Math.ipynb`: Statistical methods, descriptive statistics, and mathematical foundations

### Web Scraping
- **BeautifulSoup**
  - `Beautiful_Soup.ipynb`: Web scraping techniques using BeautifulSoup library
  - Examples for extracting data from HTML, navigating DOM, and data processing

### Linear Algebra Materials
- LaTeX documents covering linear algebra concepts
  - `ch0.tex`: Preface and motivation for studying linear algebra
  - `ch1.tex`: Mathematical objects (scalars, vectors, matrices, tensors)
  - `ch2.tex`: Properties of matrix operations
  - `ch3.tex`: Systems of linear equations
  - `ch4.tex`: Additional linear algebra topics
  - `LinearAlgebra.tex`: Main document compiling all chapters
  - `compile.sh`: Script to compile the LaTeX documents into PDF

## Learning Progression

This repository reflects my learning journey, showing the progression from basic concepts to more advanced applications. Each notebook represents milestones in my understanding and practical experience with data science tools and techniques.

## Purpose

1. **Track Learning Progress**: Document my growth and development in Python and data science
2. **Reference Implementation**: Create examples I can refer back to for future projects
3. **Knowledge Repository**: Build a personal knowledge base of techniques and approaches
4. **Skill Demonstration**: Showcase my evolving skills and understanding of concepts

## TODO

- Complete the remaining Linear Algebra chapters:
  - Finish writing `ch4.tex` with advanced topics
  - Add examples and exercises for each chapter
  - Review and refine existing content
- Convert `Math.ipynb` to LaTeX format:
  - Structure statistical content into proper LaTeX chapters
  - Complete the remaining statistics topics
  - Add visualizations and examples
- Cover more data science applications:
  - Machine learning basics
  - Data cleaning techniques
  - Real-world data analysis projects
